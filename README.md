# Trustless Sealed Bid Auction 📜

Bidco is a Trustless Sealed Bid Auction platform that aims to create a seamless and user-friendly online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers across Africa using zk proofs and without the need for intermediary trust.

## Vision ✨

To become Africa's leading and most trusted online marketplace powered by cryptocurrency, empowering communities with accessible, efficient, and secure e-commerce platforms.

## Features ✨
* Trustless: The auction leverages smart contracts and implementations using ZK proofs to ensure transparency and trustlessness throughout the bidding and auction process.
* Sealed Bids: Bidders submit sealed bids, ensuring that other participants cannot see their offers, promoting fairness and preventing collusion.
* Decentralized: By utilizing implementations using ZK proofs, the auction takes advantage of decentralized infrastructure, eliminating reliance on a central authority.
* Immutable Record: All bid submissions and auction outcomes are stored securely, creating an immutable record of the auction for auditing purposes.
* Secure and Efficient: The auction design prioritizes security, keeping bidder information confidential, and operates with high efficiency, minimizing transaction costs and delays.
