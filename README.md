Trustless Sealed Bid Auction 📜
This repository contains a Trustless Sealed Bid Auction implementation built on the Cairo network. The aim of this project is to enable secure and transparent auctions without the need for intermediary trust.

Features ✨
Trustless: The auction leverages smart contracts on the Cairo network to ensure transparency and trustlessness throughout the bidding and auction process.
Sealed Bids: Bidders submit sealed bids, ensuring that other participants cannot see their offers, promoting fairness and preventing collusion.
Decentralized: By utilizing the Cairo network, the auction takes advantage of decentralized infrastructure, eliminating reliance on a central authority.
Immutable Record: All bid submissions and auction outcomes are stored securely on the Cairo network, creating an immutable record of the auction for auditing purposes.
Secure and Efficient: The auction design prioritizes security, keeping bidder information confidential, and operates with high efficiency, minimizing transaction costs and delays.
